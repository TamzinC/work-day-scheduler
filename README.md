# work-day-scheduler


## Description

Having been introduced to to JQuery and moment.js, I have used my basic understanding to build this Work Day Scheduler. This application allows you to organise your work day by enabling you to save your tasks and refer back to as and when needed. All tasks inputted by the user will be added to localStorage, so if user was to refresh or close/reopen the browser, all the saved tasks will remain! For ease of use, the Scheduler will display the current day of the year and makes it easy to identify the current, past and future hours.

To add a task, simply start typing in the text area next to the relevant time. Once done, click on the save button on the right. This will display a pop-up on your screen to let you know that your task has been saved and added to the localStorage:

All the saved tasks will remain in the Scheduler, even if the browser is refreshed or closed/reopened. The current hour will be highlighted in red, any past hours in grey and any future hours in green.
